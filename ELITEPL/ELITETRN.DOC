Elite Plus Trainer
------------------

	I don't have much to say about this game since I will never get
into it. I can't dogfight by rolling.

	The trainer keys will give you unlimited fore and aft shields,
zero out the laser temp, unlimited missiles, and invulnerability.

	If you have invulnerability on, you can collide with any ship and
survive. However, don't collide with ships that you can dock with.
